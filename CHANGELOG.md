# 22.05

CachyOS was founded a year ago. After almost one year of development, we are really proud to announce our first Stable Release of GUI Installer.
We spent a lot of time investigating repo management, kernel development, infrastructure, theming, ... and finally put them all into the CachyOS GUI Installer.
All the features we worked on and implemented into the Installer are just trying to offer users a completely customizable experience.

The most exciting changes are that we use now for the online install pacstrap which provide then a complete clear installed environment and we do support a complete native support for the zfs filesystem

Since Discord restrict the length of the messages the full announcement can be found here:
